AI Personalized Knowledge Companion is a Python application that helps students, researchers and professionals turn raw study materials into clear, interactive learning resources. It can ingest text from PDFs, images and audio, automatically clean and organize it, then use modern NLP and machine-learning models to create summaries, generate practice questions, build flashcards and power a conversational tutor. With built-in semantic search, difficulty prediction and progress tracking, the tool adapts to your learning pace and gives personalised recommendations â€” making it easier to study, review and understand large amounts of information.
