        Machine Learning Fundamentals
        
        Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning:
        
        1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs.
        2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.
        3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties.
        
        Key concepts include:
        - Feature engineering: Selecting and transforming variables for models
        - Model validation: Techniques like cross-validation to assess performance
        - Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
        - Bias-variance tradeoff: Balancing model complexity and generalization

        Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. The "deep" in deep learning refers to the number of layers in the network, typically ranging from three to hundreds of layers.
        
        The key advantage of deep learning is its ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data. Lower layers learn simple features like edges in images, while higher layers combine these to recognize complex patterns like faces or objects. This automatic feature learning eliminates the need for manual feature engineering, which was a major bottleneck in traditional machine learning approaches.
